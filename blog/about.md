This is my Jekyll blog to write about my web development journey. It's mostly to help me put thoughts to "paper" but also to help anyone else on their journey who is stuck on problems that I figured out and spent way too much time trying to figure out on my own.

You can find my GitHub profile at:
{% include icon-github.html username="dpcleveland" %} and my portfolio at [danielcleveland.io](http://danielcleveland.io).
